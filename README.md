Spider-PE: A Tool to Support the Execution of Software Processes

This repository contains the free software tool Spider-PE, which aims to flexibly support the software process enactment in a semiautomated way. This tool is one of the outcomes from the SPIDER Project, which provides a set of technology solutions to  best attend to the good software practices described in CMMI-DEV and MR-MPS-SW. It is expected that this tool might be able to facilitate the  monitoring of the software process and reduce the costs of such phase. This cost reduction occurs due to the use of free technologies, which results in no costs to the organization.
